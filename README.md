Splitter
========

Splitter is a box2d slicing engine used to split shapes into smaller ones. It comes with a simple texture mapping class that can texture your split shapes for you, given the original box2d body and texture co-ordinates. Also, its under MIT liscence.

## Dependencies
Splitter needs a few things to build and run:
- C++ compiler (gcc for instance)
- Opengl
- SFML
- Box2d
- Codeblocks (if you which to open the project file)

Currently no CMAKE is available, but will be soon.

## Usage
Splitter extends b2RayCastCallback, so you will only need to perform 2 raycasts to get box2d bodies to split, (Check the example main class for details).

```CPP
    Splitter splitter;
    m_world.RayCast(&splitter, point1, point2);
    m_world.RayCast(&splitter, point2, point1);

```

Splitter allows you to register both a callback class (which much extend B2BodySplitCallback) or a function to recieve callbacks when a box2d body has been split. You can then use TextureMapper class to get a vector of b2Vecs of your texture coords (see example main for more details). Below is a simple example:

```CPP
    splitter.registerBodySplitCallback([&box2dWorld](std::vector<B2BoxBuilder> splitBodies, b2Body* body) -> void {
       TextureMapper textureMapper(30.0f);
       Texcoords *parentBodyTexCoords   = (Texcoords*) body->GetUserData();
       std::vector<b2Vec2> texCoords = parentBodyTexCoords->textCoords;
       
        for(auto builder : splitBodies) {
            b2Body* newSplitBody = builder.build(m_world);
            Texcoords *texturesForNewBody = new Texcoords();
            std::vector<b2Vec2> newBodyTexCoords =  textureMapper.mapSplitBody(newSplitBody, body, texCoords);
            texturesForNewBody->textCoords = newBodyTexCoords;
            newB->SetUserData(texturesForNewBody);
        }

        box2dWorld.deleteBody(body);
        delete parentBodyTexCoords; 
    });

```
